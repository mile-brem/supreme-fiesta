    "I had a problem as most of the analyses at these later packages has been done by some proper mad lads only in python. Therefore, I switched from R to python to complete these analyses. I converted my seurat object into a anndata object and we can load it back in here.\n",

    "The first analysis I get to do is cell2fate as an RNA velocity analysis.\n",

    "Now, there are other trajectory analyses but tbh they're a little shit tbh when considering what we need to do. I think conceptually they don't encounter for de-differention within cell types as they calculate a pseudotime from 0 to 1. However perhaps RNA velocity will give a more unbiased result of the directions in which genes are heading although I think it also calculates pseudotime.\n",
